<br />
<br />
<h2 align="center">‚ú® What‚Äôs Inside: An Entire PM Lifecycle, Automated</h2>

**Go from Zero to Strategy in Minutes**: Generate PESTLE analyses, Porter's Five Forces, and TAM/SAM/SOM reports automatically. Run complex competitive analyses (SWOT, Red-Teaming, Pre-Mortems) while you sleep.

**Deeply Understand Your Users**: Instantly create Jobs-to-be-Done reports, user journey maps, and Opportunity Solution Trees from your raw research.

**Build & Ship with Confidence**: Go from a prioritized MVP backlog to a theme-based product roadmap, a full technical system design, and a ready-to-code PRD‚Äîall with a few clicks.

**Simulate the Future**: Use the Business Strategy Simulator to run multi-round "war games" against competitors, stress-test your strategy, and identify risks before they happen.

<h2 align="center">ü§î How to Use</h2>

**These prompts encode wisdom from industry experts to give you world-class outputs. Get strategy advice inspired by Roger Martin, product discovery guidance from Teresa Torres, and competitive/market analysis based on popular frameworks used in top-tier (MBB) consulting.**

**Browse the Prompts**: Explore the txt files for various PM tasks.

**Copy & Customize**: Use prompts directly with your preferred LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).

**Provide Inputs**: For each prompt to run correctly, ensure all inputs mentioned under its [input placeholder] sections are provided by you.

**Integrate & Automate**: Connect with your favorite product tools or automation platforms for workflow improvements.

**For best results**: It is recommended to use these prompts sequentially as outlined in the workflow below. When used in this order, their responses build upon the outputs generated by previous prompts. For example, the MVP Feature Prioritization prompt is designed to use the results from Business Strategy, User Journey Mapping, and Opportunity Solution Tree Mapping.

However, the prompts can also be used individually, provided you supply all the necessary details and context for the AI to base its research and responses on.

ü§î **Sample Workflow**:

Copy any prompt i.e. business-strategy.txt ‚Üí Paste into ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude/Perplexity ‚Üí Enter details about your business or product ‚Üí Generate product strategies in minutes.

Use the multiple competitive-analysis prompts (1-5) ‚Üí Get a comprehensive competitive analysis report that collates all results.

Input the responses from mvp-feature-prioritization.txt, product-roadmap-generator.txt and technical-system-designer.txt into the prd-generator.txt prompt ‚Üí Auto-draft your next PRD.

<h2 align="center">üìà Workflow: The Recommended Order of Prompts</h2>
For a comprehensive product development lifecycle, from initial idea to execution, it's recommended to use the prompts in the following logical order. This workflow ensures that each step builds upon the insights from the previous one.
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2 align="center">Phase 1: Strategic Foundation & Market Analysis (The "Why")</h2>

This phase is about the big picture: understanding the macro environment, the industry, the market size, and defining a robust business strategy to win.

**Startup Plan Generator**: AI acts as a senior strategist, to generate a comprehensive, six-stage business playbook using a flexible set of established strategic frameworks.

**Market Sizing (TAM, SAM, SOM)**: AI acts as a Lead Market Analyst, to generate a comprehensive and defensible market sizing report (TAM, SAM, SOM) by performing top-down and bottom-up calculations based on user inputs and cited public data.

**Competitive Analysis-1** - (SWOT by Mixture of Experts): AI simulates a "Mixture of Experts" panel: a Product Manager, Marketer, and Business Analyst, to perform a multi-dimensional SWOT analysis on competitors, culminating in a synthesized report that identifies an actionable, underserved market niche.

**Competitive Analysis-2** - (Red Teaming): AI simulates a panel of experts to analyze and predict the timing of competitor's strategic moves.

**Competitive Analysis-3** - (Analogy Analysis): AI acts as a Harvard strategy professor. Use historical business analogies to identify the strategic blind spots of competitors.

**Competitive Analysis-4** - (Pre-Mortem): AI performs a "Pre-Mortem" analysis on competitors by generating two distinct future scenarios for each.

**Final Competitive Strategy Report**: Consolidate all competitive insights from previous analyses into a single, actionable report that defines an underserved niche and a corresponding action plan.

**Market Analysis-1** - (PESTLE): AI acts as a Senior Business Strategist, to generate a formal PESTLE analysis brief by identifying the top 2-3 macro-environmental factors for a business idea and detailing their specific strategic implications.

**Market Analysis-2** - (Porter's 5 Forces): Generates a "Market Attractiveness Report" by rating the intensity of Porter's Five Forces and defining their strategic implications for a given business.

**Business Strategy**: Generates a formal "Strategy Document" by applying Roger Martin's Strategic Framework and VRIO analysis to user-provided business research.

**Business Strategy Simulator Sandbox**: Runs an autonomous, multi-round business "war game" by role-playing as the user's startup and competitor CEOs, culminating in a strategic summary of the market simulation's outcomes.

<br />
<br />

<h2 align="center">Phase 2: User & Problem Discovery (The "Who" and "What")</h2>

This phase focuses on deeply understanding the target user, their needs, pains, and the core problems to be solved.

**Product Discovery (User Research)**: AI validates detailed user personas to simulate 15 user interviews and generates a comprehensive Opportunity Discovery Report using the Jobs-to-be-Done and Opportunity Solution Tree frameworks.

**Jobs To Be Done Report**: Synthesize raw user research findings and personas into a formal report detailing each user group's core job, functional jobs, pains, and desired outcomes.

**Opportunity Solution Tree Mapping**: AI acts as a product discovery coach, to transform a business outcome and user research into an Opportunity Solution Tree, mapping user needs to potential solutions and experiments.

**User Journey Mapping**: Creates a detailed User Journey Map by breaking down a user's goal into stages and mapping their actions, thoughts, feelings, and pain points at each step.

<br />
<br />

<h2 align="center">Phase 3: Solution Definition & Execution Planning (The "How")</h2>

This phase translates user insights and opportunities into a concrete plan for development and delivery.

**MVP Feature Prioritization**: Defines and prioritizes the core features for your Minimum Viable Product. Uses a prioritization framework like MoSCoW to transform user opportunities and an MVP goal into a detailed feature backlog and scope document.

**Product Roadmap Generator**: Synthesizes strategic goals and a prioritized feature backlog into a formal, theme-based product roadmap using a "Now, Next, Later" structure.

**Technical System Designer**: AI acts as a Technical Product Architect, to generate a comprehensive "System-Level Feature Specification" by translating product discovery inputs into a detailed, engineering-ready technical design document.

**PRD Generator**: AI acts as a Product and UI Architect, to generate a complete, PRD bundle with an ultra-modern UI design and all necessary machine-readable artifacts for AI-driven prototyping with Bolt/V0/Google AI Studio/Replit.

**Brainstorm New Features**: Facilitates a structured brainstorming session to generate, analyze, and prioritize new feature ideas for an existing product, culminating in a detailed, actionable shortlist and a machine-readable JSON artifact.
